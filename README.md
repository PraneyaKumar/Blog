Blogging website called "The Alphabet Soup" 

I built "The Alphabet Soup Blog," a visually appealing and user-friendly website catering to diverse topics. This project demonstrates my front-end development skills, focusing on creating an engaging and informative experience for visitors.

## Key Features:

- Clean and Responsive Design: The website utilizes HTML, CSS, and potentially a UI framework (e.g., Bootstrap) to deliver a clean and responsive layout that adapts seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Intuitive Navigation: Clear and well-structured navigation allows users to easily explore various blog categories and find content that interests them.
- Card-Based Layout: Content is presented in visually appealing cards, featuring captivating images, informative titles, and concise descriptions, making it easy for users to scan and find relevant articles.
- Author Information: Each blog post incorporates author information, fostering a sense of connection and credibility.
